# SimCasino.ExampleScriptMod

Source code for both Example Script Mods for SimCasino.

Note that I manually referenced everything so references may not be found for you locally - you can find all required DLLs (except for Harmony) inside the games Data/Managed/ folder.
For Harmony the best option is to use the workshop version: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2580071349 Subscribe to it and reference the DLL in the workshop content folder of Steam/SimCasino.

For any questions be sure to join our Discord: https://discord.gg/py29nCw and ask us anything in the #mods-general discussion!
